# Awesome books for Engineers

During my career as a Software Engineer I have been presented with books that one must read to be sucessful and, although, some of them are not related to Engineering, all of them provides a lesson that can be used by the Engineer in his career.

# Notes

There is no need of providing a cronological or alfabetical order on these, specially because they will all give you at least one thing, knowledge. On the same note, there is no need to provide links to purchasing the books specially because each one will have a preferrable source for acquiring them.
